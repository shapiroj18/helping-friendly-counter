## Commands
`Friendly Color` for changing color of the extension

## Known Issues
* Certain numbers will not work with summations:
  * Highlighting text such as `-3-4` reads as an invalid number unless `-3` or `-4` is just highlighted and therefore just shows line count

## Notes
* The name of this extension is an homage to the band [Phish](https://phish.net/) and their Helping Friendly Book.
