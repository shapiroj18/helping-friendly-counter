## Commands
### `Friendly Color` 
Allows you to change the color of the extension. If you want to update it permanently, go to `Code > Preferences > Settings > Extensions > Helping Friendly Counter` and update the `settings.json`

## Known Issues
* Highlighting text such as `-3-4` reads as an invalid number unless `-3` or `-4` is just highlighted and therefore just shows line count

## Notes
* The name of this extension is an homage to the band [Phish](https://phish.net/) and their Helping Friendly Book.
